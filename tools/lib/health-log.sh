# The health log's shell appender, canonical copy (TOOL-aGraftedHelix-8, interface I3).
#
# Every automatic self-heal in a copy-installed kit appends one line here: the checker setting an
# unset hook path, the resume tick relaunching a stale run, the gate runner reaping a dead bar's
# beacon. Each of those used to be reported only on the stdout of the process that made it, which
# nobody reads; the orientation card counts this file instead.
#
# USAGE: `<prefix>/lib/` ships nothing, so a writer cannot source this file. Each one carries the
# block between the markers below INLINE, byte-identical, and the parity table in
# `resolve-python.test.sh` beside this file reds a copy that drifts. Its Python twin, with the same
# contract, is the `health_log_py` block in `health_log.py` beside this file.

# >>> health_log_sh — canonical copy: health-log.sh in gov's lib dir (byte-identical; gated)
# I3, THE HEALTH LOG (TOOL-aGraftedHelix-8): `<git-common-dir>/health.log`, one LF-terminated UTF-8
# line per automatic self-heal, four TAB-separated fields: utc (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00`), source
# and event (each `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`), and a detail whose TAB, CR and LF are each folded to one space
# and which is cut to 240 characters. At HEALTH_LOG_CAP_LINES lines the appender first keeps the
# newest half, through a temp file and a rename, then appends. `derive_health_log <common-dir>` prints
# the path and spawns nothing; `resolve_health_log <repo-dir>` asks git once and prints it, or fails
# printing nothing; `add_health_event <log> <source> <event> <detail>` is the only writer. A refused
# token, an empty path or a failed write prints ONE `health: NOTE -` line on stderr and returns 0: it
# never fails its caller. WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: serialize concurrent writers (a trim racing an append
# can lose that line; ponytail: one rename, a lock file if a lost line is ever observed); validate
# what a detail means; or tell a repository with no writer installed from one where nothing healed.
