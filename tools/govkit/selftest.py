"""govkit selftest — every refusal and every reported state, exercised in throwaway repos.

Contract: the deployer unit's spec under memory/builds/aSealedCaravan/spec/

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. `check-arms.py`'s population is tracked `*.sh`, so nothing in this repo
demands arms from a Python write path — the unit resolved that deliberately and moved the guarantee
to the test layer instead. This is that layer. Each arm asserts a SPECIFIC message or on-disk effect,
never an exit code alone: an exit code shared by six unrelated outcomes is the exact ambiguity the
descriptors' outcome probes exist to resolve, and a test that accepted one would be reproducing it.

Every fixture is a throwaway repo under `mktemp`-equivalent. Nothing is written into this repo.
