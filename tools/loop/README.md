# loop — the loop's definition: the gov steps, and where each workflow sits in them

A governed build runs one loop: Plan, Design, Build, Test, Deploy. This kit is where that loop is
written down. `loop.toml` holds it as data, `loop_lib.py` is its one reader, and every other kit that
needs a step or a workflow's place asks the reader. The roles kit keeps WHO does the work, its role
files and its workflow table; this kit holds WHAT runs and in which step. Contract: TOOL-dDeclaredLoop-1.

## The definition, `loop.toml`

One `[[step]]` row per gov step, in the loop's order:

| key | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `tag` | the step's tag, `step.plan` to `step.deploy`, a member of the `step` namespace |
| `order` | its place in the loop, counted from 1 |
| `state` | the build state a build holds while it is in the step |
| `exit` | the step's exit item, a tag of the `item` namespace |

One `[[workflow]]` row per workflow of the roles kit's `workflows.toml`:

| key | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `name` | the roles workflow, the join key |
| `order` | its build order, 0 for an any-time workflow; the `## Stage <n>` number in the `/build` Skill |
| `step` | the step its work sits in, a `[[step]]` tag, or `none` |
| `reach` | optional, `entry` or `review`: the word its work orders load practices under |

A workflow's `step` says where its work sits in the loop. Its reach word says which reach of each
practice its work orders carry: the row's `reach` where it has one, else the last segment of its
`step`, else `none`. The two differ on three rows: `orient` serves no gov step and loads the `entry`
reach, and the two review workflows sit in Design and Build and load the `review` reach.

## The reader, `loop_lib.py`

| function | returns |
|---|---|
| `load_loop(kit_dir)` | the checked definition, `{"step": [...], "workflow": [...]}` |
| `read_steps(kit_dir)` | the step rows, in the loop's order |
| `read_workflow_order(kit_dir)` | `{workflow name: order}` |
| `read_workflow_reach(kit_dir)` | `{workflow name: reach word}` |

Each refuses a definition that does not hold with `LoopError`, a `ValueError` naming the file and
the row: the gov steps missing, repeated or out of order; a workflow named twice; an `order` that is
not an integer at or above 0; a `step` that is absent or is neither a step tag nor `none`; a `reach`
outside `REACH_WORDS`.

A kit reads it by finding this kit's directory with its own `resolve_kit_dir` and importing the
module from there. Three readers do today: the roles kit's `roles_lib.read_workflow_order`, which its
catalogue checker joins with the workflow table both ways (rule R6) and its adopter binds the
Skill's stage headings to; and the playbook kit's drive section and load-set check, which sort the
drive rows by `order` and pick each role's practices by its reach word.

## The commands

- `python loop_lib.py --check` reads the definition and prints one line per step and per workflow.
  Exit 0 read, 1 refused with the reason on one line. It is the `loop definition` gate leg.
- `python loop_lib.py --fixture --plant <case>` reads the shipped definition with one break made in
  memory, and exits 1 on the refusal that break must draw. The cases are `missing-step`,
  `reordered`, `bad-step` and `bad-reach`. Nothing on disk changes.
- `bash adopt-loop.sh --check` runs the first through the resolved python. The kit renders
  nothing, so its adopter has no `--scaffold`.

## What it does not check

That a workflow row names a workflow the roles kit holds: the roles catalogue checker joins the two
both ways. That a step tag or an exit item is registered: the tag index reads the `[[step]]` rows as
the `step` namespace. That an exit item exists: the item rows are a later unit's. An unknown key on
a row is neither read nor refused.
