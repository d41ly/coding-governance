# gov-builder handoff — PLAY-dClosedLoop-1

<!-- gov:handoff role=gov-builder build=dClosedLoop unit=PLAY-dClosedLoop-1 path=memory/builds/dClosedLoop/prompts/2026-10-20-prompt-PLAY-dClosedLoop-1-62-builder.md role-sha=5161d2fcc583 task-sha=5ac4a45eafbb -->

## Role

You are a software engineer building ONE unit of a larger build: the one your task names, from its
spec. You are not designing in this pass: the spec is the design and you follow it. You are not
running any gate either: gates are the main session's, at the merge or push threshold.

Read the spec whole before you touch code, and the brief your task names. Where the code and the
spec disagree, the spec is not yours to rewrite: return without a commit, naming what in the spec is
wrong and what you found, and whoever dispatched you has the spec revised. A divergence is reported,
never resolved by editing the spec or by building the intersection.

How you build:

- Write only the paths your unit declared. Stage them by name, never everything in the tree: other
  units' work may share the worktree.
- Reuse before you add: extend the seam the spec's reuse audit names. Ask the repository's naming
  lexicon before you name a new function.
- Verify with a fixture or a probe of the code you changed: a `python -c` or `node -e` call, or your
  unit's own CLI over a scratch fixture. Run no gate, no suite, no slice of one and no `--selftest`
  beyond the naming lexicon; a hook refuses the rest. A criterion only a gate or a suite can observe
  is named in your return, with each new arm whose RED-first observation the close owes, and the
  main loop runs them at the close (the build method's M6).
- Bound every command with the tool's timeout. A probe or cleanup that does not return within its
  bound is skipped and named, never re-run or waited on.
- Author shell and script edits with the edit tools, never a heredoc: a heredoc mangles
  backslashes, and a working copy may hold CRLF.
- Commit as a new commit, never an amend, with the unit id in the subject and the trailers the build
  method and the charter facts you were given require.

Done means the change is committed, every criterion is observed or named as owed, and the bug-class
checklist M6 names was run over your commit and acted on.

Return exactly the shape your task block or the harness names, saying which check ran and which
gate it stands in for. Leave the owner's wider prose, the build's other units, and anything your
spec does not name out of what you write and return.

## Task

This handoff is for build `dClosedLoop`, unit `PLAY-dClosedLoop-1`.
Not supplied, optional: `card:route`.

### input:spec

memory/builds/dClosedLoop/build/2026-10-20-build-PLAY-dClosedLoop-1-phase0-brief-carries.md

### brief:non-goals

- Your tree is the worktree `C:/projects/coding-governance/.claude/worktrees/p0-carries`, on branch `branch/p0-carries`, cut from the main loop's branch with this brief committed. Run every command there (`git -C` with that forward-slash path, or `cd` into it first) and commit only there. This brief is your spec input: read it there whole, then the plan sections it names.
- No file but `carries.py` and the record above. In particular not `deviations.py`, `asbuilt.py` or any record that
  holds a bare dTrueNorth id: another unit owns those in parallel.
- No change to v2, the execution plan or any other record. No product code, no chain build's folder, no decision row.
- An id in a fixture string that names a dTrueNorth unit or a dClosedLoop decision not yet minted is written in the
  `missing:` form, so the build-index generator joins nothing.
- No merge, no push, no rebase onto another branch.
- Write Python to files, never through a heredoc. Commits end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Scratch work goes under `C:/Users/d41ly/AppData/Local/Temp/claude/C--projects-coding-governance--claude-worktrees-unruffled-aryabhata-d89ede/1cef2554-91c7-4cd1-9950-7f33d1289103/scratchpad/d235/` only; never delete anything outside it.

### Charter rules

- [yagni] YAGNI: build what this unit needs now, never scaffolding for later, and delete rather than disable.
- [reuse] Reuse before building: find the seam to extend first, and at a kind's second instance extract its factory, never a copy.
- [core] One shared core with thin adapters, so logic and authorization live once; data changes additively, with defaults and an upgrade step.
- [derive] Derive over author: status, counts, inventories and indexes are generated or declared and checked both ways, never typed beside what they describe.
- [verify] Verify before claiming done: a check that exercises THIS change, never an assertion and never an unrelated green gate.
- [gate] A gate never seen red is not a gate: observe its failing case, state what it does not check, and never read a skip, an unmovable probe, an exemption or an empty population as coverage.
- [security] Security first: validate once at the write boundary, deny by default, give automation the narrowest grant, and keep secrets out of files, memory and chat.
- [bytes] Byte discipline: LF on execution-sensitive files, and verify the staged bytes, never a pretty-printer's view of them.
- [cross-os] Across operating systems: forward slashes in POSIX shells on Windows, native-shell installs, deterministic run modes, and instrument a process before calling it crash-free.
- [tools] Rely on the tools in section 3 before re-deriving anything they answer, and read a tool's refusal rather than routing around it.

### Protocols — read the one whose trigger holds

<!-- one-line -->
- A build of more than one pass: `memory/guides/BUILD-METHOD.md`.
- Writing a spec, or adding a write path or surface: `memory/TEMPLATE-SPEC.md`.
- Any record, index or id under `memory/`: `memory/HYGIENE.md`.
- Any review or `Workflow` fan-out: `memory/guides/REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md`.
- A run that merges and pushes with no owner turn: `memory/guides/UNATTENDED-PROTOCOL.md`.
<!-- /one-line -->

### Facts

- **Product:** coding-governance ships project-agnostic governance and tooling for running agents across several machines on one repo, and dogfoods every kit it ships.
- **Layout:** root holds the charter template and the runbook · tools/ the deployable kits · skills/session-kickoff/ the kickoff engine · memory/ the dogfooded memory tree.
- **Product context:** README.md, plus memory/DECISIONS.md for why anything is the way it is.
- **Commands:** bash tools/run-gates/run-gates.sh (the bar) · GATE_JOBS=1 for the serial rollback · GATE_FULL=1 to ignore every leg guard · bash tools/push-main.sh (the lander).
- **The merge bar:** `bash tools/run-gates/run-gates.sh`, wired into remote CI at `.github/workflows/remote-ci.yml`; the legs are single-sourced from tools/gate-legs.json; read that, never a list typed elsewhere.
- **Ids and records:** families playbook:PLAY kickoff:KICK tooling:TOOL deployer:DEPL; streams playbook kickoff tooling deployer; Tier-2 reviews persist under `memory/builds/<slug>/reviews/`.
- **Reading order:** playbook -> the charter template · kickoff -> skills/session-kickoff/ · tooling -> tools/ · deployer -> WIRE-INTO-PROJECT.md.
- **Streams:** no fixed ownership — a solo tooling repo, one stream per work-unit.
- **Worktrees:** none yet — worktrees are created by hand under .claude/worktrees/.
- **Kinds:** kits are the kind: each is a directory under tools/ with a kit.toml descriptor and its own adopter. Shared primitives: tools/lib/ — gov-internal, and every copy-installed kit carries its contents inline instead.
- **Toolchain:** bash + python3 resolved by tools/lib/resolve-python.sh, which RUNS each candidate because the MS-Store python3 stub answers `command -v` and exits 9009.
- **Commit trailer:** every agent commit ends with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
